# PLV
## Personal Light Vehicle
### Specification
#### Version 0.1

---
### Abstract
The "Personal Light Vehicle" or PLV is designed to be a new 'Quasi-Standard' for affordable, individual motorized mobility.

##
## Design Goals
### General 
#### A PLV is not a car - at least not as per [EU Vehicle Class M1](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/EG-Fahrzeugklasse#Klasse_M_(Personenbef%C3%B6rderung)).
Instead it's meant to be the "mininmum viable product" of a vehicle - even if that means it's "not legally a car" but a superlight vehicle as per [Class L2e](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/EG-Fahrzeugklasse_L2e) or [L5e](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/EG-Fahrzeugklasse#Klasse_L).

The core paradigm is to design and build the most affordable, compact yet safe means of transport that is road-legal.

###
### Efficiency
The PLV is designed to be the counter-development to the flood of [Super Useless Vehicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle#Nicknames) that are inherently wasteful beyond reason and rationale and are mostly being purchased for ego reasons and rarely out of practical reason or necessity.

As such it should put efficiency and minimalism first to the maximum legally possible extent.

###
### Economy
The PLV needs to be economically priced and within reason.
- Supercars in the price ranges of [€ 400.000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumpert_Nathalie) and [€ 111.000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_1-litre_car#Production_and_sales) are completely out of the question and comletely fail at this goal.
  - Economy isn't solely measured by fuel efficiency, but must account the Total Cost Of Ownership (TCO) from the inital purchase to salvage with all consumeables and maintenance costs in between.
    - A target price half if not lower than the cheapest car is desireable.
    - Base price should be at € 5.000 [as of 06.2022 - adjustments per inflation are allowed if unavoidable].

## Bare Minimum Specification
This needs to be clarified amidst the need to make it a quasi-standard.
### Speed and Class
Depending on the market and desired classification different options may apply.

These definitions exist mainly to allow for a distinction that may be necessary for legal reasons.

#### In theory, all these could be based off the same chassis design.

For consisten Terminology we'll hereby define the following types:
#### PLV 1
This basically is classified as either an "electric wheelchair" and thus will be equipeed and locked down to remain license- insurance- and tax-free, being regulated like an "enclosed bike".
- This means a top speed of 6km/h in the EU & Germany.
#### PLV 2
This should fulfill the EU vehicle class L2e and be classified as a "three-wheeled, enclosed scooter", only requiring an easy to obtain driving permit an insurance plate.
- These should offered at 25km/h.
  - Like with existing scooters, these can be limited by the [ignition system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_discharge_ignition) like in commercial scooters.
#### PLV 3
Like PLV 2, but maximum Speed is 45km/h.
#### PLV 4
Like PLV 2, but considered a "Trike" due to using an engine with >50cm³ or 4kW & being faster than 45km/h.
- These may legally fall under motorcycle licenses A1, A2 or A depending on whether these have <15kW, 15-35kW or >35kW total output.
These are based off the L5e classification and thus are limited by 15kW engine output.
#### PLV 5
Like PLV 4, but with engine Output limited to 35kW.
#### PLV 6
Like PLV 4, but with engine Output exceeding 35kW.
#### PLV 7
These would be any other trike design.
#### PLV 8
These would be any other compact vehicle trying to fill that nieche.

### Vehicle Exterior Features
- Whilst no minimum nor maximum dimensions will be decalred, the core principles of the PLV concept demand efficient use of space and materials.
- Legally mandated minimums and features have to be included.

### Vehicle Specifications
#### Basic Features
- It must have an enclosed cabin that makes it safe and comfortable to drive all-year around in common weather in Germany.
  - A "canopy" that also acts as door and either folds to the roadside or is being pushed/pulled to the front or rear is desireable.
    - Similar to the [Messerschmitt KR200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Kabinenroller)
- It must have 1 + 2 seatting, allowing up to 3 adults (incl. driver) [@ 2m height, 125kg weight each] to be transported safely and with reasonable comfort.
- It must be as accessible as possible.
  - Accessibility features should be accounted for.
- It should use a 4/5-point belt harness up front and 3-point belts at the rear so that wearing a helmet is not legally mandated.

####
#### General Form
To allow the most efficient design, a "Tricycle" form with two wheels in the back and 1 steerable wheel in the front is desireable.

#####
##### Engine Placement
If technically possible, it's recommended to have a "mid engine" just barely before the rear axle and positioned as low as technically possible.

If the vehicle is having direct drive electrical motors integrated at the wheels, said position would be recommended for the batteries instead.

This is done to both take use of the aerodynamical causality that results in a trunk as well as increase both stability and handling.

####
#### Useable Capacity
Since the PLV needs to be useable as a fully-fledged car replacement by most people, it needs to be useable as such.
- Besides the driver, it must also support the following load configurations:
1. at least 1 210L ISO steel drum barrel filled at capacity with water = 225kg gross weight @ 215l total volume
2. at least 1 Passenger + 1 120l steel drum barrel filled at capacity with water = 130kg gross weight @ 125l total volume
3. at least 1 Passenger + 2 60l steel drum barrels filled at capacity with water = 65kg gross weight & 65l total volume each.
4. 2 Passengers and 1 25l canister.
5. 2 Passengers and 2 10l canisters. 
Driver and Passengers are hereby defined at 2m height and 125kg weight to allow both for safety margins and more realistic load than 75kg @ 1,75m.

#### Standards
- [Kei Car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kei_car) as an incentive towards smaller and more efficient vehicles.
#### Projects & Products
- [VW L1](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konzeptfahrzeuge_von_Volkswagen#2002:_VW_1L_%E2%80%93_das_Ein-Liter-Auto_%E2%86%92_XL1) for the general design.
  - In fact, the [VW XL1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_1-litre_car) is just a facelifted [VW Scooter](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konzeptfahrzeuge_von_Volkswagen#1986:_VW_Scooter) with a turbocharged Diesel engine.
    - At [only 200 built](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/VW_XL1#Serienbau), it's basically just an absurdly expensive showcase of "German Engineering" that is road-legal.
      - So it basically it an [EcoHipster alternative to a rare Porsche](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozqSdnkYxJM).
  - Still the [low drag and excellent fuel mileage is impressive and noteworthy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2BoM2qdrSw).
- [Messerschmitt KR200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messerschmitt_Kabinenroller)
  - A post-WW2 "cabin motorcycle" that reused much of the old stock of Messerschmitt parts, like the transparent canopy top and "steeringh wheel" from a fighter plane.
- Several small vehicles, like the [GECO 8.0](https://aj-emobile.de/neufahrzeuge/elektroautos/78/elektroauto-geco-twin-8.0-7.5kw-inkl.-72v100ah-batterien-strassenzulassung-max-78-km/h) which is a highway-legal car in Germany,
- Motorized Trike-Scooters with cabins, may it be [micro-sized boxtruck](https://aj-emobile.de/neufahrzeuge/e-nutzfahrzeuge/69/3-kw-elektro-nutzfahrzeug-truck-xc-kasten-max.-45-km/h), [Pick-Up](https://aj-emobile.de/neufahrzeuge/e-nutzfahrzeuge/68/3-kw-elektro-nutzfahrzeug-truck-xp-pick-up-max.-45-km/h) or [enclosed cabin scooters](https://aj-emobile.de/neufahrzeuge/bach-scooter-danmark/) like the [UMI M3 CITY GO](https://aj-emobile.de/neufahrzeuge/umiw3city-go/65/umi/w3/city-go-e-moped-fuehrerscheinfrei-kabinenroller-25-km/h-3-kw-li-ionen-90-290-km-reichweite).
- [Microlino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlino)
  - Basically a remake of the [BMW Isetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isetta) that is 'legally not a car' but a light vehicle as per [EU Class L7e](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/EG-Fahrzeugklasse_L7e).
    - It's kinda misunderstood as a ["secondary or tetriary urban car" by testers from German Car Club ADAC](https://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/autokatalog/marken-modelle/auto/microlino/).
      - This market should not exist!
  - At an MSRP starting €17.690 and going up to over €22.690 as well as it's low-volume production it's not gonna have any major impact and will most likely only ending up scalped by collectors and fans of the original Isetta and maybe driven by the few people who want it.
- [Krause Duo](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duo_(Krankenfahrzeug))
  - A GDR-made & discontinued 2+0 three-wheeled motor "wheelchair" with a soft-top and hand-crank in lieu of the kick-starter common with it's [two-stroke M541 engine](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/M541_(Motor)) in later revisions which is legally considered a "scooter" in Germany today.
- [Peraves ecomobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecomobile) 
  - A"cabin motorcycle" with automatic extending and retracting stabilizer wheels which is [remarkably comfortable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbdkZB9-Sd4)
    - as of now, only the [electric variant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvCakq8mU) is in production and being offered.
      - It sadly seems to [suffer from tipping-over issues](https://youtu.be/xzK012GjjX4?t=43) unlike the original Version.
- [Carver One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carver_(automotive_company))
  - A [tilting three-wheeler](https://youtu.be/LY4pmvaibJA) that is utilizing a [banked turning system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carver_(automotive_company)#Dynamic_Vehicle_Control_system) to make it drive more dynamically...

These may fulfill the nieches for some, but they are either quite crammed and thus less accessible and/or quite restricted to make them fulfill criteria like L2e & L5e vehicle classes without being unsellable expensive.
- Also a lot of these are discontinued 
  - Many have no chance of being re-certified as originally built under current safety requirements.
    - Extensive re-engineering would be required that would only keep the original looks from the outside.
